title: App Privacy
---

This app privacy policy is very simple: **your data is yours**.

- If the app includes any **sync support**, it will use the system sync service that is **under your control**.
- If the app stores any **health data**, it will do it on-device within the system health service **under your control**.
- If the app uses any **complex processing** technique, the app will do it on-device or through a system service so the processed and resulting data will be always **under your control**.
