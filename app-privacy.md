Our app privacy policy is simple: **you data is yours**.

- If the app includes any **sync support**, it will use the system sync service that is **under your control**.
- If the app shows or generates any **health data**, it will do it on device within the system database **under your control**.
- If the app uses any **complex processing** or Machine Learning technique, the app will do it on device where the resulting data will be **under your control**.

That's it, simple!
