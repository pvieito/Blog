title: App Privacy
---

This app privacy policy is very simple: **your data is yours**.

- If the app includes any **sync support**, it will use the system sync service that is **under your control**.
- If the app stores any **health data**, it will do it on-device within the system health service **under your control**.
- If the app requests **screen recording** permissions, the app will use this capability on-device and the resulting data will be always **under your control**.
- If the app includes a **subscription** option, an anonymous subscription identifier will be sent along any **explicit user request** that requires server-side processing to validate the subscription status.
- If the app uses any **complex processing** technique like Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence models that requires sending data out of the device to services like OpenAI, only the **data explicitly selected by the user** to be processed will be sent.
