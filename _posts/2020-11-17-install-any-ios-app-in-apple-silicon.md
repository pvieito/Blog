Apple silicon Macs can run iPhone and iPad apps natively using the same [Mac Catalyst technology](https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/) that powers apps like [Twitter](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/twitter/id1482454543?mt=12) or [Darkroom](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/darkroom-editor-de-foto-v%C3%ADdeo/id953286746) on macOS. Although all iOS apps are by default directly available on the Mac App Store, developers can opt-out and make their apps unavailable. Unfortunately, some of the most popular apps like [Instagram](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/instagram/id389801252), [Deliveroo](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/deliveroo-comida-a-domicilio/id1001501844) or [Netflix](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/netflix/id363590051) have been removed from the Mac App Store… but that does not mean they cannot run on macOS, they are simply hidden in the Mac App Store. If you have purchased or downloaded any app from the iOS App Store, you have the option to make a backup of it using an [IPA file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ipa), and those files can be used on Apple silicon Macs to install any iOS app.

Currently there are multiple approaches to download those IPA files for any iOS app:

- Use [iMobie M1 App Checker](https://www.imobie.com/m1-app-checker/) to easily download and export your apps.
- Download them using [iTunes 12.6](https://support.apple.com/es_ES/downloads/itunes) in a compatible Mac or PC.
- [Use Apple Configurator on the Mac](https://medium.com/@b0661064248/how-can-i-get-ipa-of-any-app-which-is-available-on-app-store-3a403be7b028).

Once you have the IPA file, you can simply copy it to any Apple silicon Mac, double click it and _voilà!_
