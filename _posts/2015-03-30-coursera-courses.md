[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) is a [MOOC](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOOC) platform with thousands of courses from different universities and institutions. These are some I have found very interesting:

* [**Cryptography I**](https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto) from *Standford University*
* [**Software Security**](https://www.coursera.org/course/softwaresec) from *University of Maryland*
* [**Computer Networks**](https://www.coursera.org/course/comnetworks) from *University of Washington*
* [**Cryptography**](https://www.coursera.org/course/cryptography) from *University of Maryland*
* [**Fundamentals of Digital Image and Video Processing**](https://www.coursera.org/course/digital) from *Northwestern University*
