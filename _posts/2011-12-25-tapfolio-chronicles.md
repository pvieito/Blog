[Tapfolio](http://app.tapfolio.com/) is a nice stock portafolio app for iPad. During this Christmas it is be available for free and now can be downloaded in Europe (previously was only in the United States and Canada App Store).

When I discover it I decided to give it a try, after playing a few minutes with it, I realized that there was a bug. I kept trying to create new stock "investment" –the app can keep track of your shares and calculate your profit in real time– but I was not able to finish the steps because the "Finish" button was disabled. I let the Tapfolio developers know the bug through their Twitter account (@TapfolioApp), with a screenshot for reference:

Shortly afterwards, they told me it was strange and they could not reproduce it so they recommended me to reinstall the app. I did it, but it still did not work.

However, yesterday I realized it could be something related to the language or region configuration, as Tapfolio is developed in Canada and it had been available in Europe only for a few days. I tried setting the system language to English with no success. Then I tried changing the "Regional Settings" to United States and the app started to work perfectly, so I let them know:

What I did not expect was the sudden response, in which I was thanked for finding the bug origin and they told me I had a $20 gift card coming my way:

> @pvieito Thank you for finding it! You have a $20 gift certificate coming your way, just DM us with your details :)

Indeed, shortly I received an email and $20 by PayPal. A nice story to start Christmas. From here I would like to thank Tapfolio developers for this gesture and encourage everybody to try [their app](http://itunes.apple.com/app/id474031446?mt=8&affId=2007332).
